# TicTacToe Game with Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of a TicTacToe bot using the Q-Learning algorithm.
You can play against the bot or let it play against itself.
To train the model, run the `train.py` script. Feel free to edit the rewards and hyperparameters in the `train.py` file. The models ( first player (p1) / second player (p2) ) will be saved in the `models` folder.

To play against the bot, run the `game.py` script. You will play in second each time. But you can change this and start first by editing the `game.py` file in the `main` part.

## Requirements

run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
