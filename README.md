# TicTacToe Game with Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of a TicTacToe bot using the Q-Learning algorithm.
You can play against the bot or let it play against itself.
To train the model, run the `train.py` script. Feel free to edit the rewards and hyperparameters in the `train.py` file. The models ( first player (p1) / second player (p2) ) will be saved in the `models` folder.

To play against the bot, run the `game.py` script. You can choose the model you want to play against when in the terminal you will choose to begin or not.
